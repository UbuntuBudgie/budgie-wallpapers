 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW
 IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
    1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
    anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
    unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
    (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
    Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
    arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
    version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
    condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
    transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
    purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
    is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
    the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
    considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
    under the terms of this License.
    4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
    Work.
    5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
    the terms of this License.
    6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
    7. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
    attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
    this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
 other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
    1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collective Works;
    2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
    perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
    transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
    perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
    transmission Derivative Works.
    5.
 .
       For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
       composition:
          1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
          waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
          or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC),
          royalties for the public performance or public digital
          performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
          2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
          the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
          music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
          Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
          Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
          compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
          Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
    doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
    exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
    performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
    public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
    the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
    Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
    License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
    Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
    that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
    exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
    and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
    the Work with any technological measures that control access or use
    of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
    Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
    Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
    If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
    any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
    2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
    of this License, a later version of this License with the same
    License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
    license that contains the same License Elements as this License
    (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of,
    or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
    license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
    phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
    not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or
    restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
    the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
    that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
    You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
    technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
    The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
    Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work
    apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the
    terms of this License.
    3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
    Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
    the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
    utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
    applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
    Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
    name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to
    the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier,
    if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
    unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
    credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
    appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
    comparable authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
    Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
    their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
    remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
    7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
    here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
    the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
    or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
    to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
    to You under this License.
    2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
    Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
    granted to You under this License.
    3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
    no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
 .
 Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
 whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
 liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
 whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
 incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
 license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
 Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder,
 it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
 .
 Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
 Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
 "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons
 without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted
 use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark
 usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
 does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
 Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
 other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
 information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

 terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
 disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
 fullest extent possible.
 .
 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
 .
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and
 .
            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
 .
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
 .
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
       5. Downstream recipients.
 .
            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.
 .
            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
 .
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:
 .
                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);
 .
                ii. a copyright notice;
 .
               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
 .
                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;
 .
            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
 .
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
  b. ShareAlike.
 .
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
 .
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
 .
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
 .
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
 .
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so

     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.
 .
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.
 .

     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
